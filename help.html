		<h3 style="text-align:right"> What is an alternative spring break? </h3>
		<p style="text-align:right"> Alternative Spring Break is where a group of 10-12 college students engage in volunteer service for a week as a counter to "traditional" spring breaks. Each break has a focus on a particular social issue, such as poverty, education reform, refugee resettlement, prison reintegration, animal welfare, homelessness, and the environment. Students learn about the social issues and contribute to week-long projects with local non-profit community partners. Alternative breaks are also drug and alcohol-free experiences, with a heavy emphasis on group and individual reflection.</p>

		<h3>  Spring Break 2020 </h3>
		<p style="text-align: left"> Before the Corona Virus shut down the nation, I spent my spring break on my first JMU alternative break.  It seems like a blur at this point, so I decided to make this website to hopefully preserve some of my memories. This website will focus on my trip in particular, and ways to get involved with the community. I chose this topic  because I have always been passionate about service, and thought it would be interesting to meet likeminded people.</p>
		
		<br> 
		
			<p style="text-align: center"> There are many ways to get involved with service. You can volunteer your time, or donate your resources. You can also support local, small businesses by shopping smart. </p>
