		<h1>How to Help </h1>
		<h2> Shop Smart </h2>
		<p> One way to get involved is to shop smart! Where and how you spend your money has an impact on the economy and the products that continue to be manufactured and distributed. It is extremely important to be conscious of the quantity and quality of products being purchased. The textile industry is one of the main contributors to pollution through their use of inks, dyes, and synthetic chemicals along with large amounts of water contaminated by these materials. Our society is stuck in a viscous cycle of mass consumerism and mass production. This pattern has caused a reduction in cost and quality which leads to higher consumption. A great way to reduce this cycle is to buy local, quality items or second hand to avoid supporting the mass production of goods.
